I developed a computationally efficient signal processing method to reconstruct the 6D infomation - 3D localization $\langle x,y,z\rangle$ and 3D orientation $\langle \theta,\phi,\Omega \rangle$ - of biological samples through fluorescence microscope. 

This method is robust and fast to solve high-dimensional inverse problem through one frame shot of the target object. Detailed infomation is listed in the [Poster](https://osf.io/6ce3t). 

## An Active Stabilizing Feedback Module for Long-Term Super-Resolution Microscopy

Super-resolution microscopes are able to detect nano-stage drift beyond the diffraction limit, thus leading to a distortion in the image. In this project, I designed a model, based on Laguerre-Guassian (LG) modes, that was able to detect the lateral drift within 1 nm and axial drift within 4 nm.
